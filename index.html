        <h3 align="center">Welcome to my corner of the internet!</h3>

        <br>

        <p>
            I am using this website as a way to develop my web design skills, as I am coding it all from scratch, and
            as a space to explore my other interests. I love all things marine science, data, software development,
            and being a program coordinator.
        </p>
        <br>


        <p>
            As I combine my interests in marine science and information technology, I wanted to explore the data that I
            came across during my time working on a whale watching ship in Seattle. Although these whales are not chipped,
            they are well tracked via offshore sightings, researchers, and multiple whale watching companies. I would
            like to play around with different data visualizations and data manipulation tactics to see what can be made
            of the behaviors exhibited by different transient orca pods specifically throughout the years.

        <h4> What's Next For Me?</h4>

        <p>
            All my life, I've been obsessed with thinking like a scientist. From making "potions" in my backyard, to
            creating and working on research studies to help answer the world's questions. Because of these curiosities,
            I went to school at a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia and completed a bachelor's
            degree in biology and chemistry. I am now working on my second Ivy League degree: a master's in Computer and Information
            Technology.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am also searching for internships and full-time jobs, while completing my master's degree part-time. I am open
            to a variety of roles and fields, but my top interests are Marine Research, Data Science, and Program Management.
