        <h3 align="center">Welcome to my corner of the internet!</h3>

        <br>

        <p>
            I will be populating this website with some of my interests and passion projects. I hope to get into
            app development             and will be linking this website to the apps.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am someone who has always been a self-starter, and I believe my career up to this point demonstrates my
            tenacity. My parents didn't have the chance to go to college and the counselors at my school were
            unfortunately overworked and undertrained, to where they didn't even know what SAT subject tests were and
            how essential they were for college applications at the time. So, I navigated the college application
            process by myself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Ultimately, I managed to complete two associate's degrees before I even graduated high school, where I then
            graduated as Salutatorian of our large school. I continued on to receive an Ivy League degree in Biology and Chemistry, and I am
            currently completing my second Ivy League degree: a Master's in Computer and Information Technology.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Because my interests lied in the biological sciences, I entered the field of clinical research. I now have
            four years of experience working in this area, from creating studies from scratch and seeing them
            through to their conclusion, to coming on to previously established studies and coordinating between its
            patients and different stakeholders to make sure it runs smoothly. Throughout my years of experience, I have
            had the pleasure to work with incredible individuals, improving my communication and leadership skills. At
            my last job, I trained new employees, supervised nurses during our shifts, managed the schedules of our study patients,
            and served as the liaison for the 21 staff working on the study, championing the art of a good email
            and facilitating conversations.
        </p>

        <h4> What's Next For Me?</h4>

        <p>
            I am searching for internships and full-time jobs, while continuing my master's degree part-time. I am open
            to a variety of roles and fields, but my top interests are: Marine Research, Program Management, Software Development,
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I will also continue to learn outside of school, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while I develop this website, and
            Swift while I work on some app ideas.
